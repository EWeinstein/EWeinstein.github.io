**Eli N. Weinstein**

I'm a 5th year PhD student in the Program in Biophysics at Harvard, advised by Debora Marks ([link](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/index.html)) and Jeff Miller ([link](https://jwmi.github.io/)). In work in the fields of Bayesian statistics, probabilistic machine learning, biophysics and genomics.

I develop statistically- and biophysically-principled computational tools for modern molecular biology. My primary theoretical interests are in the  statistical foundations of existing computational biology techniques, from the perspective of Bayesian methodology. My primary applied interests are in understanding complex biological sequence dynamics, especially over very short timescales (programmed mutagenesis systems) and very long timescales (the whole of evolution). Other research themes include model misspecification, approximate Bayesian inference, high throughput synthesis, and pathogen forecasting. I have an amateur interest in the intersection of molecular biology and public policy.

I received my A.B. from Harvard in 2016, concentrating in Chemistry and Physics. I worked with Adam Cohen, developing computational pipelines for analyzing high-throughput single-cell electrophysiology data. My graduate research is supported by a Hertz Foundation Fellowship ([link](https://www.hertzfoundation.org/)).
