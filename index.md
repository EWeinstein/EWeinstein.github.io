# Eli N. Weinstein

I'm a 6th year PhD student in the Program in Biophysics at Harvard University, advised by Debora Marks ([link](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/index.html)) and Jeff Miller ([link](https://jwmi.github.io/)). I am also a scientific consultant at Jura Bio ([link](https://www.jurabio.com/)). I develop statistical tools for molecular biology, working in the fields of Bayesian statistics, probabilistic machine learning, biophysics and genomics. In Summer 2022, I will be joining David Blei's group ([link](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/)) at Columbia University as a postdoctoral fellow.

My primary applied interests are in generative statistical methods for biological sequences. Generative models enable not only rigorous inference from complex sequence data, but also prediction of unobserved or future sequences that can be synthesized in the laboratory. They have application in evolutionary biology, immunology, microbiology, virology, clinical genetics and many other areas of biology, biomedicine and biotechnology. I develop new strategies for building sequence models, evaluating sequence models, and designing experiments based on sequence models, aiming for practical and scalable techniques with theoretical guarantees.

My primary theoretical interests are in Bayesian methodology, especially frequentist analysis of Bayesian methods, as well as issues related to model misspecification and robustness. Much of my work formalizes, generalizes and analyzes successful heuristic techniques and ideas in the field of computational biology broadly and biological sequence analysis specifically.

I received my A.B. from Harvard in 2016, concentrating in Chemistry and Physics. I worked with Adam Cohen, developing analysis methods for high-throughput single-cell all-optical electrophysiology data. My graduate research is supported by a Hertz Foundation Fellowship ([link](https://www.hertzfoundation.org/)).
