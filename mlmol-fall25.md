Machine learning and AI have transformed scientific data analysis. But the experiments that generate data are usually taken as given. Better algorithmic control of scientific experiments could lead to better learning, enabling the next generation of scientific AI.

This semester, we will study the fundamental theory of experimental design. We'll read foundational statistical ideas about how to quantify the amount of information an experiment provides. We'll study emerging ML methods and algorithms for optimizing experimental designs. And we'll look at how these ideas are beginning to be applied in science, with a focus on protein design and engineering. Overall, our aim is to provide a background for researchers interested in advancing the frontier of ML-guided experimentation. 

**Thursdays 1-2:30pm, Room 207-222 (DTU Chemistry). First meeting: September 25.**

About ML & Molecules reading group: ML & Molecules is a new reading group organized by Asst. Prof. Eli Weinstein (DTU Chemistry) and Assoc. Prof. Jes Frellsen (DTU Compute). It focuses on fundamental probabilistic machine learning and its intersection with the molecular sciences. Everyone in the group presents a paper, in a rotating schedule. It is open to students, postdocs, faculty and staff. It is not a formal course, but can optionally be taken as a project course, for which you will receive course credit.
